# NekoScraper 🐱‍💻

> **⚠️ Best performance achieved with Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Floorp, etc.) — Chrome compatibility is available, but things might break.**

**Blazingly fast Java-based scraper** for a very specific university’s grade portal—rewritten from my old Python scraper from first year, now turbocharged with Java and Selenium’s **`ExpectedConditions`** for speed and stability!

A great amount of effort has been put to build this tool, and it was very enjoyable. If you have any problem with the tool please email me.

`Unless you are from my university...you probably don't need this tool.`

## 🚀 How to use

1. Head to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/ritesh-debnath-12/NekoScraper/releases/latest) page and download the latest version.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, then open it and configure:
    - Semester (e.g. `SEMESTER=1`)
    - Browser binary path
    - Driver paths (Chrome, Gecko)
    - Payload URL
    - etc, just look inside the .env you will know
3. Double-click the `.exe` in the folder. 🖱️
4. If something breaks, check the logs and send them my way(my email is at my profile)!

## 🛠️ How to Build from Source

Requirements:
- ✅ A Computer with Windows 10 or 11..idk might work with 7 ig? Just make sure its 64-bit
- ✅ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- ✅ [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?.)
- ✅ [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=21)
- ✅ [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) ~~(or your favorite IDE)~~(for your and my sanity...don't use anything aside from IntelliJ)
- ✅ ~~[WiX Toolkit](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases)~~ No longer necessary as app-image is used
- ✅ PowerShell (for Windows packaging) <- If you don't got this and you run a Windows Machine...[only this man can save you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus).
- ✅ [7z](https://7-zip.org/download.html)
> **⚠️ Maven and Java should be available in the PATH. How? [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGRw1bgb1gU)...**


### **Build steps (PowerShell snippet)**:

Create a `test.ps1`(or anything, just make sure it ends with a .ps1) and paste these inside

```commandline
Set-PSDebug -Trace 1
mvn -X clean package

# Clean leftover jars
Remove-Item -Force target/original-*.jar

# Create custom JVM runtime
$modules = jdeps --multi-release 21 --print-module-deps --ignore-missing-deps target/NekoScraper.jar
jlink --output uniscraper-runtime --add-modules $modules --no-header-files --no-man-pages

# Prepare distribution folder
if (!(Test-Path dist)) { mkdir dist }

# Package into a portable app-image
jpackage --name NekoScraper --input target --main-jar NekoScraper.jar --main-class me.neko.Main --app-version "1.0" --win-console --app-content drivers --runtime-image uniscraper-runtime --type app-image --dest dist

# Copy config and docs
copy .env.example dist\
copy README.md dist\

# Zip it up
& "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a "NekoScraper-1.0.7z" ".\dist\*"
```

Save and exit...double clicking test.ps1 should work, if not then run it from a terminal
```powershell
.\test.ps1
```

### Build steps **(I want to do it myself, because I like banging my head against the keyboard)**:

Alright Sherlock. Here is your step-by-step DIY 2-Minute Crafts(think that was their name):

- Git clone the repo(use git bash or other terminal...cmd is also an option)
- Open the root of the project
- Clean the target folder and make a FATASS package
```commandline
mvn -X clean package
```
- Find the dependencies required by the application
```commandline 
jdeps --multi-release 21 --print-module-deps --ignore-missing-deps target/NekoScraper.jar
```
- Copy the comma separated output(java.base, java.logging etc)
- Paste the output in the end of this command which creates a small custom runtime
```commandline 
jlink --output uniscraper-runtime --no-header-files --no-man-pages --add-modules [PASTE_HERE]
```
- Bundle it all up in a nice symphony
```commandline
jpackage --name NekoScraper --input target --main-jar NekoScraper.jar --main-class me.neko.Main --app-version "1.0" --win-console --app-content drivers --runtime-image uniscraper-runtime --type app-image --dest dist
```
- You can zip it using 7z
```commandline
C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe a "NekoScraper-1.0.7z" ".\dist\*"
```
Your zip(.7z) should be ready. Can't open it? [Use this](https://7-zip.org/download.html)

Brownie points to you if you added 7z to the path and used it like that!

> Or you can skip all this and run it using IntelliJ 🤷

## ❓FAQ

Q: **Why Firefox is recommended?**

A: Chrome handles downloads differently and timing can break automation (switching tabs, etc.).

Q: **Q: Can I run this on macOS or Linux?**

A: Idk, did not test it. Needs some configuration with the commands, try it! or give me a holler!

Q: **Q: Do I really need to do the .env.example to .env?**

A: Yes. How else is the machine supposed to know what you want? If you can create a Swing GUI for me, it will be appreciated!

Q: **Build fails with Java errors?**

A: This machine logs almost everything...open the log folder and give me the scraper.log(email at my profile)

Q: **Why?**

A: Because I can.

Q: **Why Java?**

A: I like Ryan Gosling
